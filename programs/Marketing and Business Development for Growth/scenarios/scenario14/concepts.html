        </p>

        <!-- Concept 1 -->
        <h3>1. Market Segmentation and Targeting</h3>
        <p>
          Market Segmentation involves dividing a broad market into distinct subsets of consumers with common needs or characteristics. Targeting then focuses on selecting the most viable segments to pursue with tailored strategies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilize CRM data to categorize dormant channels by factors such as past sales volume, region, and product specialization.</li>
          <li>Focus reactivation efforts on segments with higher growth rates and larger market shares to maximize return.</li>
          <li>Develop tailored re-engagement strategies for each segment based on their unique characteristics and needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Formulas:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Segment Size = Number of Potential Customers in Segment</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Growth Rate = (Current Year Segment − Previous Year Segment) / Previous Year Segment × 100%</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Market Share = (Company’s Sales in Segment / Total Sales in Segment) × 100%</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Market Share Calculation:</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Company's Sales in Segment: INR 20 Lakhs</li>
            <li>Total Sales in Segment: INR 100 Lakhs</li>
            <li>Market Share = (20,00,000 / 1,00,00,000) × 100% = 20%</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <!-- Concept 2 -->
        <h3>2. Marketing Mix Optimization (4 Ps)</h3>
        <p>
          The Marketing Mix comprises four key elements: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Optimizing each element ensures that the company's offerings meet customer needs while achieving business objectives.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure that the products offered through reactivated channels meet current market demands and client specifications.</li>
          <li>Use price competitiveness index to ensure that pricing strategies are attractive to distributors yet sustainable from a company profitability perspective.</li>
          <li>Reactivate and potentially expand the number of distribution channels to maximize market reach in targeted regions.</li>
          <li>Implement targeted promotions, such as exclusive discounts or limited-time offers, to encourage immediate re-engagement to incentivize dormant channels to re-engage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Formulas:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Product Fit Score = Number of Features Aligned with Customer Needs / Total Number of Features × 100%</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Price Competitiveness Index = (Company’s Price / Average Market Price) × 100%</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Distribution Coverage = (Number of Active Channels / Total Potential Channels) × 100%</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Promotion ROI = (Revenue Generated from Promotion / Promotion Costs) × 100%</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Promotion ROI Calculation:</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Incremental Revenue: INR 80 Lakhs</li>
            <li>Promotion Costs: INR 10 Lakhs</li>
            <li>Promotion ROI = (80,00,000 − 10,00,000) / 10,00,000 × 100% = 700%</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <!-- Concept 3 -->
        <h3>3. Branding and Positioning Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          Branding involves creating a strong, positive perception of the company and its products in the minds of customers. Positioning refers to how the company's products are perceived relative to competitors, emphasizing unique value propositions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strengthen the brand image to be seen as reliable and innovative, increasing the attractiveness of re-engaging channels.</li>
          <li>Ensure all reactivation campaigns and communications consistently reflect the company’s brand values and messaging.</li>
          <li>Clearly communicate unique benefits and value-added services to distinguish GlobalFusion from competitors in RFP responses such as superior product quality, customization capabilities, or exceptional customer support.</li>
          <li>Use testimonials and case studies from existing customers to build credibility and trust with dormant channels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Formulas:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brand Equity = Brand Awareness × Brand Loyalty × Perceived Quality</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Positioning Index = (Perceived Unique Value / Competitive Value) × 100%</strong></li>
          <li><strong>CSAT = (Number of Satisfied Customers / Total Number of Responses) × 100%</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example Metric:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brand Equity Calculation:</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Brand Awareness: 80%</li>
            <li>Brand Loyalty: 70%</li>
            <li>Perceived Quality: 90%</li>
            <li>Brand Equity = 0.80 × 0.70 × 0.90 = 0.504 (or 50.4%)</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
