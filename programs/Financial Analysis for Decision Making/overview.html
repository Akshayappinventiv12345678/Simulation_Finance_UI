          <h2>Simulation Brief</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          This simulation helps apply the concepts learned during the program. By engaging with realistic scenarios,
          learners will enhance their ability to navigate organizational challenges. These simulation scenarios are
          meticulously mapped to programs and woven into cohesive mini-case studies centered around a manufacturing
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The simulation encourages decision-making on market scenarios that CXOs encounter
          in an organization. Participants are encouraged to discuss the options and choose one option. The financial
          impact of the selected option will be shown in updated financial statements after each selection.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Duration:</strong> Each scenario is expected to take 10 minutes. One can move to the next scenario or
          end the simulation to exit. Please download your final statements at the end of the simulation. Data might not
          be available afterward. You might not be able to return to the previous scenario or the simulation briefs,
          once you move on to the next scenario.

          <h2>Key Assumptions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Below assumptions have been made for the sake of simplicity:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Entries related to accrual / capitalization for bid preparation / proposal cost, unbilled revenue
            accounting, progress payments, income tax entry, additional sales incentive, or warranty have not been
            considered to focus on application than possible accounting scenarios.</li>
          <li>Scenarios assume immediate cash collection. In reality, there might be a delay between sales and cash
            collection.</li>
          <li>The entries assume a perpetual inventory system. For the periodic system, adjusting the timing of
            inventory and COGS entries is required.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">

          <h2>Participant Brief</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          You are the CXO of a manufacturing organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Board of Directors and shareholders expect the organization to increase its top line by 30% Year on Year
          and achieve at least 20% profit after tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per market conditions, various scenarios are presented to increase sales, control costs, and improve cash
          flow. This can be through commercial bidding, investing in new products, expanding to new markets, investing
          in new capital equipment, or M&A opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decisions can be taken based on various scenarios that are presented during simulation.
